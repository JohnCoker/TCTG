Now you can take ThrustCurve.org with you to the launch site, even if the launch is at Black Rock desert!

Search for motors and mark your favorites to make them available offline.

You can even enter a few bits of info about your rocket and use the Motor Guide to find motors that work.
Then you'll have a list of working motors and performance estimates with you.

This makes it easy to choose a motor for that one extra flight you hadn't planned to make.
No more guessing; know what motors will work and how they will perform before you buy.

Motor data at your fingertips; ThrustCurve to-go.
